.. note::
   For now, some fields of :class:`~model_compression_toolkit.target_platform.OpQuantizationConfig` are ignored during
   the optimization process such as quantization_preserving, fixed_scale, and fixed_zero_point.

   - MCT will use more information from :class:`~model_compression_toolkit.target_platform.OpQuantizationConfig`, in the future.
