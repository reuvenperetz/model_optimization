.. note::
   For now, some fields of :class:`~model_compression_toolkit.target_platform.OpQuantizationConfig` are ignored during
   the optimization process (currently, the quantizer type, number of bits, and quantization enable/disable information
   are in use).

   - MCT will use more information from :class:`~model_compression_toolkit.target_platform.OpQuantizationConfig`, in the future.
